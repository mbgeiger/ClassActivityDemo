<p>I am currently working in the software field as a test engineering manager.  I have worked in the field for five years starting out as a tester.  Hobbies I enjoy outside of work include spending time with my family, training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and watching football.  I have two young boys that are 3 and 7 years old.  I was born and raised in Kennesaw Georgia.</p>
